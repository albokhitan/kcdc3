## Frontend development tooling

This project uses Gulp for frontend development automation. Build scripts are based on [gulp-starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter). 

Theme styles are written in SASS, compiled to CSS, and minified for production. Similarly, JavaScript files are concatenated and minified.

The Gulp tools use node-sass, which doesnâ€™t support:
- Compass
- Suffix selectors, i.e. for BEM notation
